            <h2>EC2 and S3 Interaction using Boto3 and Python</h2>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <h3>--Introduction--</h3>
                    <p>
                        For this project I was aiming to a build a basic replication of the AWS console but only for EC2 and S3 services using python3 and boto3.
                        I built a user-friendly CLI that lets users interact with AWS EC2 and S3 services such launching an EC2 instance or pulling a list of your S3 buckets
                        but with far less granularity when interacting with these services.
                    </p>
                    <h3>--Requirements-</h3>
                    <p>
                        There will be user-friendly CLI for the user to interact with and from here, user should be able to pass arguments and values that should perform tasks
                        like listing ec2 instances or s3 buckets, change instance state, or upload or delete buckets and objects. User actions will also be logged to an S3 bucket
                    </p>
                    <h3>--System Interactions--</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User friendly CLI will be created with the help of the argparser module </li>
                        <li>User requests which are passed as arguments will be handled with boto3 functions</li>
                        <li>These boto3 functions and code will talk directly to the AWS service by utilizing its service API and creating a console session with the service(S3, EC2, etc.)</li>
                        <li>IF statements will be implemented that will invoke functions based on arguments passed</li>
                        <li>User actions will be logged through the use of the logging module. File to store the logs will be created upon running the script and then uploaded to S3</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span class="project-expand">
